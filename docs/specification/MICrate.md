## Custom Context and Extended Metadata:
allows to define custom fields within your RO-Crate metadata document and describe how they should be interpreted.

```
"@context": [

    {
      "organism_classification": "https://schema.org/taxonomicRange",
      "obo": "http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/",
      "acquisiton_method": {
        "@reverse": "https://schema.org/result",
        "@type": "@id"

# Guidelines

## Which type of RO-Crate should I use (attache or detached)
### Quick checklist – are you building the right type?

1. Do you know the total size of the files?
        < 5 GB → attached is fine.
        > 5 GB → think detached.

2. Do you control the licence of the files?
        Yes, you can share them → attached.
        No, you can only provide a citation → detached.

3. Will the data ever be updated?
        No, it’s a static snapshot → attached.
        Yes, you’ll keep a “live” version → detached.

4. Do you need an easy, single‑file transfer?
        Yes → attached.
        No, you’re fine with a list of URLs → detached.

If you answer “yes” to 1–3, go with attached; otherwise, go detached.
